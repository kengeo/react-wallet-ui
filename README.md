# Wallet Library

The components in this library should be able to allow developers to create a personal finance application like the Monzo, or be used to integrate a wallet into a non finance focused app like GoJek or Uber.

The latter would want to simply keep track of credits and payment history -- which the former is more gared towards money management.
